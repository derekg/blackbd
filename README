Blackbd is a simple HTTP service that takes form encoded POST requests converts them to 
key/value pairs, stuffs in them into a JSON Object, and then on GET requests returns a 
JSON array of the JSON Object. It implements a circular LIFO buffer w/ a definable size 
that controls the number of JSON Objects that should be kept.  POST may be protected
w/ HTTP Basic Auth.  

Why? 
-> Great scalability for transient data. 
-> Not sure
